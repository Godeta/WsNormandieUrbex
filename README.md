# WsNormandieUrbex
A website on urbex spot available in Normandie with pictures, description and sometimes a bit of history.

### Beware of the dates
Some pictures might be old comapared to the time you see them, check the dates below the pictures to be sure this is still actual, because who knows the place might have changed.

### Be respectfull
If you ever come across those sites, you can of course visit them and take pictures but always make sure not to deteriorate the place in any way ! (don't throw garbage or break stuff basically)

### Be careful
Some of the areas might be high and the structures could have became brittle with time so always make sure to be safe before doing anything there.
