    <h2> Beware of the dates</h2>
    <p>
        Some pictures might be old comapared to the time you see them, check the dates below the pictures to be sure
        this is
        still actual, because who knows the place might have changed.</p>

    <h2> Be respectfull</h2>
    <p>
        If you ever come across those sites, you can of course visit them and take pictures but always make sure not to
        deteriorate the place in any way ! (don't throw garbage or break stuff basically)</p>

    <h2> Be careful</h2>
    <p>
        Some of the areas might be high and the structures could have became brittle with time so always make sure to be
        safe before doing anything there.</p>
